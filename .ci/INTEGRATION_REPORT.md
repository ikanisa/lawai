# Integration Report â€“ 2025-10-23 03:00 UTC

## Base
- Default branch: work
- Integration branch: integration/merge-all-branches-20251023

## Branches merged
- *(no active remote branches detected; repository appears to be single-branch state)*

## Dependency Actions
- Package manager: pnpm
- Adjusted @opentelemetry/api to ^1.9.0 for compatibility with published releases
- Regenerated pnpm-lock.yaml via `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile=false`
- Manual TypeScript fixes applied to avoid reliance on unpublished library APIs

## Tests & Builds
- `pnpm -r lint` *(fails: deno-based workspaces require Deno in PATH)*
- `pnpm -r typecheck` *(fails: deno-based workspaces require Deno in PATH)*
- `pnpm -r build` *(partial success: packages built except apps/ops, which still lacks several internal dependencies and type declarations)*
- Targeted builds for @avocat-ai/observability, @avocat-ai/compliance, @avocat-ai/shared, and @avocat-ai/supabase now pass

## Conflict Resolution Policies Applied
- Environment references replaced with guarded globalThis lookups for Deno compatibility
- package.json: unified dependency versions; lockfile regenerated once post-integration
- TypeScript strictness retained while providing local declaration shims where upstream packages lack typings

## Manual follow-up required
- Provision Deno runtime (and ensure `deno lint` scripts) for lint/typecheck workflows
- Restore missing internal packages referenced by `@apps/ops` (`@avocat-ai/api-clients`, shared scheduling/transparency modules, PG type declarations)
- Provide TypeScript declaration packages for `pg` (e.g., `@types/pg`) or local shims to unblock ops toolkit build

## Next Steps
- Review updated packages (observability, supabase, shared, compliance) for release readiness
- Re-run monorepo lint/typecheck/build once Deno runtime and internal dependencies are available
