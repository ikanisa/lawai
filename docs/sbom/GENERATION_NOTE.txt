SBOM Generation Note
====================

The SBOM JSON files will be automatically generated by the GitHub Actions workflow
when this PR is merged. The workflow (.github/workflows/sbom.yml) will run on:

- Push to main, master, or work branches
- Pull requests to these branches
- Release events
- Manual workflow dispatch

Expected SBOM files (will be generated):
- api-sbom.json
- web-sbom.json
- pwa-sbom.json
- ops-sbom.json
- edge-sbom.json
- shared-sbom.json
- supabase-sbom.json
- root-sbom.json

These files will be generated using the CycloneDX npm plugin and will contain
complete dependency trees, license information, and package URLs (purls) for
vulnerability scanning and compliance tracking.

To generate locally (after merge):
  npm install -g @cyclonedx/cyclonedx-npm
  cyclonedx-npm --output-file docs/sbom/api-sbom.json

Or use the CI workflow to generate all SBOMs automatically.
