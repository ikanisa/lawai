# PDF file inputs for agents

The PDF ingest pipeline is designed to handle regulatory filings, court decisions, and scanned submissions so that multimodal agents can work from the same evidence used in chambers.

## Supported sources
- Signed PDF uploads from operator devices
- Supabase Storage mirrors of official registers
- Document snapshots generated by the crawl-authorities worker

## Processing flow
1. Ingest the PDF into the organisation's residency-constrained bucket.
2. Normalise metadata (jurisdiction, binding languages, residency zone) and create a provenance record.
3. Extract text with OCR fallbacks and split the document into embeddings for File Search.
4. Store chunk summaries in `document_summaries` and refresh vector embeddings for hybrid retrieval.
5. Emit telemetry so the workspace dashboard shows ingestion status, residency compliance, and guardrails activity.

## Multimodal readiness checklist
- Enable the camera/OCR quick action in Research so field teams can capture printed rulings.
- Surface residency and binding-language badges when citing PDF-derived passages.
- Keep C2PA-signed exports aligned with the original PDF metadata to preserve audit trails.
- Record acknowledgement events when PDFs trigger consent or Council of Europe treaty disclosures.
