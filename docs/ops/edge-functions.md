# Edge function authentication & testing

The edge workers now require a shared secret on every request. At least one of the
following environment variables must be populated at deploy time:

- `EDGE_FUNCTION_SECRET`
- `EDGE_SHARED_SECRET`
- `EDGE_SERVICE_SECRET`
- `EDGE_FUNCTION_SECRETS` / `EDGE_SHARED_SECRETS` / `EDGE_SERVICE_SECRETS` (comma separated list)

Requests must include the secret as either an `Authorization: Bearer <secret>` header or an
`X-Edge-Secret` header. When no secret is configured the handlers fall back to their original
behaviour for backwards compatibility, but production should always set a value.

## Running the automated checks

The package now ships a Vitest suite that shims the Deno runtime, loads each handler, and
verifies the authentication contract (401 without credentials, 200 with a valid secret).

```bash
pnpm --filter @apps/edge run test
```

The script first executes the existing Deno typecheck (skipping automatically when Deno is not
installed locally) and then runs the Vitest suite. No additional setup is requiredâ€”the tests
inject the required secrets via the mocked Deno environment. The suite enables a temporary
`EDGE_FUNCTION_TEST_MODE` flag to bypass the heavy business logic after the authentication check;
leave that variable unset in any real deployment.

## Local manual smoke test

To send a manual request against a running worker, ensure the secret is present in the
environment and include it in the request headers, for example:

```bash
export EDGE_FUNCTION_SECRET="local-dev-secret"

curl -i \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${EDGE_FUNCTION_SECRET}" \
  https://<edge-endpoint>/process-learning
```

The response should be `401` if the header is omitted and `200` (or the handler-specific status)
when the credential is supplied.
