- ❌ No container vulnerability scanning
- ⚠️ Limited documentation
- ⚠️ No structured issue reporting

**After Review**:
- ✅ CodeQL SAST scanning (JavaScript/TypeScript)

## Remaining Conditions for Full GO

### Condition 1: Enable GitHub Secret Scanning (5 minutes)

**Risk ID**: SEC-003  
**Severity**: S1 (High)  
**Owner**: Repository Administrator  
**Action Required**: Navigate to repository Settings → Security → Enable secret scanning  
**Effort**: 5 minutes  
**Blocker**: No (acceptable to defer with monitoring)

**Mitigation if Not Enabled**:
- Production deployment validates secrets against placeholder patterns
- Developers follow secret management best practices
- `.env.example` clearly documents secret handling
- Accept residual risk with manual secret reviews in PR process

### Condition 2: Implement Circuit Breaker Pattern (1 week)

**Risk ID**: REL-001  
**Severity**: S1 (High)  
**Owner**: Platform Squad  
**Action Required**: Wrap OpenAI and Supabase calls with circuit breaker (e.g., opossum library)  
**Effort**: 1 week  
**Blocker**: No (acceptable to defer with monitoring)

**Mitigation if Not Implemented**:
- Close monitoring of external service failures
- Manual intervention procedures documented in runbook
- Alerting configured for OpenAI/Supabase errors
- Implement in first post-launch sprint (4-6 weeks)
- Accept higher risk of cascading failures during external outages

---

## Deployment Recommendation

### Recommended Path: Phased Rollout

**Phase 1: Staging Deployment (Immediate)**
- Deploy with all implemented security enhancements
- Enable CodeQL, Dependabot, container scanning
- Monitor for 48-72 hours

- Test rollback procedures

**Phase 2: Production Soft Launch (Week 1)**
- Limited user rollout (10-20% traffic)
- Feature flags enabled for gradual exposure
- Enhanced monitoring and alerting
- On-call rotation established
- Daily smoke tests

**Phase 3: Production Full Launch (Week 2-3)**
- Gradually increase to 100% traffic
- Monitor SLO targets (99.9% uptime, P95 < 2000ms)
- Implement circuit breakers (post-launch priority)
- Continue Dependabot PR reviews
- Address S2/S3 risks iteratively

### Alternative Path: Immediate Full Launch with Acceptance

**Acceptable if**:
- Business urgency requires immediate launch
- Accept 2 residual S1 risks with mitigation plans
- Enhanced monitoring in place (Sentry recommended)
- On-call team trained on runbooks
- Rollback tested and ready

**Not Acceptable if**:
- Regulatory compliance requires 100% risk mitigation
- High-value targets or sensitive data without circuit breakers
- No incident response plan in place
- No on-call coverage
