**Review window:** 2024-04-09 – 2024-04-10  
**Reviewers:** Product (C. Moreau), Legal Ops (A. Niyonsaba), Engineering (D. Laurent)

## Checklist Summary

| Requirement | Verdict | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CI/CD gates enforced (lint, test, bundle budgets, Go/No-Go) | ✅ | Verified via GitHub Actions `CI` run #428 — bundle budget check passed with 1.62 MB aggregate chunk size. |
| Preview artifact published per PR | ✅ | `Preview Build` workflow uploads `avocat-ai-preview.tar.gz`; manual smoke performed on commit `work-phase9`. |
| Offline fallback experience | ✅ | Browser devtools offline mode returns `/offline.html` with Outbox chip showing queued actions. |
| Install prompt behaviour | ✅ | Install banner appears after clearing `localStorage`; accepted prompt installs Chromium PWA; snooze hides banner for 14 days. |
| Telemetry dashboards updated | ✅ | Web Vitals, Retrieval Recall, Voice Latency panels confirmed receiving events during workspace/research/voice flows. |
| Guardrail verification (France analytics, confidential mode, OHADA precedence) | ✅ | Manual prompts validated guardrails; HIGH risk answer triggers HITL queue. |
| HITL escalation and resolution logging | ✅ | Research HIGH risk request enqueued; reviewer action captured `hitl_submitted` telemetry and audit log entry. |

## Residual Risks

1. **Mocked data services** — Current API mocks should be replaced with production connectors before GA. Track via launch runbook follow-up.
2. **Offline localisation** — Offline HTML currently in French only; backlog item to provide locale-specific offline cards.
3. **Preview hosting** — Artifacts require manual extraction; consider publishing containerized previews alongside QA notes for stakeholder convenience.

## Sign-off

- Product ✅
- Legal Ops ✅
- Engineering ✅
